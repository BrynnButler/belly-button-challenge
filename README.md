# Background
In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Features  
- **Dropdown Menu**: Select a test subject by ID  
- **Horizontal Bar Chart**: Top 10 OTUs for the selected sample  
- **Bubble Chart**: All OTUs sized by sample values and colored by OTU ID  
- **Metadata Panel**: Demographic info for the selected subject
